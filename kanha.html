            <p>
                The <b>largest national park in Madhya Pradesh</b> with 941sq. km expansion, Kanha National Park is considered to be one of the best administered and managed parks in India. It is one of the Navratanas of the 'Project Tiger'.
            </p>
            <p>
                Apart from the majestic royal Bengal tigers, Kanha inhabits barasingha as well, which was very close to extinction. It was then a successful conservation programme at <b>Kanha National Park</b>, Madhya Pradesh, that brought the animal back. Therefore the park is respected globally for saving the barasingha from near extinction. It is interesting to know that 'Bhoorsingh the Barasingha' is the official mascot for Kanha National Park. You will also get to spot bison roaming freely in their natural surroundings of Kanha.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hunting ground to leopards and wild dogs, <b>Kanha National Park, Madhya Pradesh</b> also shelters over 350 species of birds and 1000 + species of flora.
